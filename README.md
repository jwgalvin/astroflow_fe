## Design Principles: 
The design of this application relies on the facade design pattern. Here's a very high level overview: 
* A controller sends a request from the front end and intiates the creation of a facade, and passes it data(params, from JSON or query) in the backend. 
* A facade is a ruby class that initializes a Service, and sends the service data to a PORO. 
* A service calls an external api enpoint(get (https://web.site?optional_param) ) and returns parsed JSON. 
* The parsed JSON is turned into a Ruby object through a PORO. 
* The object is serialized and sent to the route matching the controller action. 
* Additionally, this project uses `Google OAuth 2.0` for users to create and log into their accounts.
